# Flask API

Part of my final year project involved developing a Machine Learning API using Flask.
It hosts several machine learning models and provides prediction endpoints that are consumed by an Android mobile application written in Java (with some functionality in Kotlin).
The Flask API receives data by the mobile client, processes it using the hosted pre-trained machine learning models, and then returns prediction results. This allows the mobile app
to leverage the power of machine learning without having to directly run the models on the mobile device, thereby saving computational resources and enabling the use of more complex models
if needed.
